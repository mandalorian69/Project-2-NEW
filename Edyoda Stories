                <article>DevOps is a paradigm shift in the way how software products are being built in the modern day Information Technology (IT) organizations.

                <article>To me Data Science can be encapsulated in a simple statement, it helps organizations and individuals to solve complex problems while minimizing human effort. There are several different aspects to this, which we shall go into later.Here I have tried to answer some of the frequently asked questions by friends and juniors planning to switch their profiles and roles in the areas of Business Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.</article>
